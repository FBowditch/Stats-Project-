# High Pressure Cell

We looked at correlations between weather and arrests in Brooklyn between 01/01/2019 and 09/30/2019 to see if there were any interesting relationships. We specifically examined the relationship between the particular weather condition on a given day and the arrests taken place that day.

## Background
This was our 2nd 48-hour project at the Flatiron School (NYC Data Science)

## Project Purpose and Description
 - The goal of this project was to test our ability to gather information from a real-world database and use our knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful. 
 
## Data:
 
- **Dark Sky API**
	- Weather Data
	- https://darksky.net/dev/docs
- **NYC Open Data API**
	- Arrest Data for NYC (YTD)
	- https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc
	
## Tools (all in Python):
   - pandas
   - SQLAlchemy
   - MySQL Server on AWS RDS
   - Seaborn/Matplotlib
   - SciPy/NumPy

## Male vs Female Arrests

## Hypothesis 
 
 -H01: There is no significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests for that day.
 -Ha1: There is a significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests.

 -H02: There is no significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests by gender.
 -Ha2: There is a significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests by gender.
 
 ## Hypothesis Testing
 - T-Test
 - ANOVA
 
 ## Conclusion  
 - We failed to reject both null hypothesis. With an alpha level of .05 we are 95% confident that there is no significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests for that day during the time period examined. As well, there is no significant difference between the forecast for a particular day in Brooklyn and the number of arrests by gender. 
 
## Going Forward
- Some crimes may not have occured on the day of the arrest. Therefore, moving forward, it would be interesting to look specifically at crimes commited on a particular day and the weather forecast for that day.
 
- If we categorize arrests into violent and non violent crimes, is there a trend related to weather and violent crimes?
 
- What effect does the daily temperature have on the number of arrests?
